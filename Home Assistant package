Using a ‚ÄúPackage‚Äù File

First we need to create new file named irrigation.yaml in your Home Assistant /config folder.
Copy and paste the following code into this file to get started.
Note: In this example you will see that there are two irrigation zones configured. 
If you have more than two zones you will need to add enough `input_text` and `input_number` 
entities to accommodate your additional zones.
---
# Lovelace UI to set a list of irrigation cycle times.
input_text:
  irrigation_zone1_times:
    name: List of Times (eg. 08:00,12:00,15:00)
    icon: mdi:clock-outline
  irrigation_zone2_times:
    name: List of Times (eg. 11:00,15:30)
    icon: mdi:clock-outline

# Lovelace UI to set the duration of each irrigation cycle.
input_number:
  irrigation_zone1_duration:
    name: Duration in Minutes
    icon: mdi:timer-sand
    min: 0
    max: 60
    step: 1
    unit_of_measurement: "minutes"

  irrigation_zone2_duration:
    name: Duration in Minutes
    icon: mdi:timer-sand
    min: 0
    max: 60
    step: 1
    unit_of_measurement: "minutes"

### Optional offline notifications. Uncomment this automation if you'd like an notification 
### should the device be disconnected from the network for two hours!
# automation:
#   # Warn me if the system ever goes offline for more than two hours!
#   - alias: irrigation_system_offline
#     initial_state: true
#     trigger:
#       - platform: state
#         entity_id: binary_sensor.irrigation_controller_status
#         to: 'off'
#         for: '02:00:00'
#     action:
#       - service: persistent_notification.create
#         data:
#           title: "Irrigation System Offline"
#           message: "The Irrigation System has been offline for 2 hours!"
#           notification_id: "offline"
#       - service: notify.mobile_app_iphone_brian
#         data:
#           title: "Irrigation System Offline"
#           message: "The Irrigation System has been offline for 2 hours"

Include the ‚ÄúPackage‚Äù file in configuration.yaml
Note: You can skip this section if you are adding the above entities to Home Assistant another way.
See the Home Assistant Packages Documentation for a deeper explanation.

Simplified Lovelace User Interface
This version of the interface simply uses the built in Entities Card and optionally a Glance Card.

Create Irrigation Zone User Interfaces
You will need to add an Entities Card for each Irrigation Zone.
------------------
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: switch.irrigation_zone1
  - entity: sensor.irrigation_zone1_next
    name: Next üïë
  - entity: sensor.irrigation_zone1_remaining
    name: Remaining ‚è≥
  - entity: input_text.irrigation_zone1_times
  - entity: input_number.irrigation_zone1_duration
title: Zone 1
show_header_toggle: false

Optional: Create Irrigation Controller Status Card
